# MDB Protocol Implementation for Cashless Vending Machine with ESP32-S3 and KiCad
This is an open source project dedicated to implementing the MDB (Multi-Drop Bus) protocol for cashless vending machines, using ESP32-S3 as the main platform and KiCad for PCB design. The MDB protocol is widely used in vending machines for communication between devices, enabling integration with cashless payment systems.

# Key Features:
Implementation of the MDB protocol for communication with vending machines;
Support for integrating cashless payment systems into vending machines;
Utilization of ESP32 as the hardware platform, offering flexibility and advanced IoT features;
PCB design done in KiCad, facilitating production and customization of the hardware;
Support for EVA DTS (European Vending Association Data Transfer Standard), allowing remote monitoring and control of machines.
# How to Contribute:
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues, send pull requests, or propose new features;
Before submitting a pull request, make sure the code complies with the style and quality guidelines defined in the project;
Help us improve documentation by adding usage examples, installation instructions, and any other relevant information.
